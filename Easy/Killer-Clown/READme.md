Looking at the decription, we see that there are some interesting words which we can take into consideration.<br>

For example, we are told that Melany Parker, a 23 year old woman, resides at Northwest Berkeley and that she was reported missing after she didnt return from her evening jog.

Ok, with that information, you can ask yourself a question...
When people go to jog, what are the possible places they can pass through?
Well, you can go through parks coz of the serene environment. And also, the image that were given seems to be somewhat of a local park. 

So lets jump to google and get a look at the location in google maps.

Taking a look we can see there's at least one local park in the area....<br>
**:Cedar Rose Park**
<br>
Nice! lets zoom in a little and try to see if we can find anything else in the park....<br>
We find a pathway**:Ohlone Greenway.**
